Our mission is to accelerate reforestation to tackle climate change. We do so by providing automatic monitoring of reforestation carbon projects. Specifically, we provide AI and computer vision tools to translate drone imagery to tree-level carbon and biodiversity data. We believe that by providing independent, rigorous, transparent and efficient automatic monitoring of reforestation projects, we are building trust in reforestation carbon projects.
